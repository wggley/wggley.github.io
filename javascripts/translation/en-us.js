Until the entry is accepted by pressing the accept icon <img src="images/accept.png"></img> its value will not be considered and its date, if expired, will be the current.<code>date: 2008-01-01?</code><h3>Transfers</h3>To make a transfer, leave the category field empty, when moving to the "from account" a new field will appear: "to account", type the origin and the target in each field, by pressing the add button two entries will be made: a debit and a credit.<h3>Data Editor</h3>Use the data editor feature to edit the text data source, it is very handy in some cases.<br/>Each field is TAB separated, just press apply to save your changes, a backup file with a "old" file extension is generated with the previous data.<h3>Search and Filter</h3>To perform some specific filtering, use the text field on filter panel. You can also use regular expression.<p>Examples:<br/>To filter the "entertainment" entries of January 2008:</p><code>2008-01.+entertainment</code>Filtering "entertainment" and "gift" entries:<code>2008-01.+(entertainment|gift)</code><h3>Data exportation</h3>Javascript is not a good solution to work with a large amount of data, so it is recommended to work with about +/-5000 entries or one year. To manage that you can, by the end/begin of the year (or another period), export the data, copy the entire myMoneyLog folder to another place and rewrite the file "data.html" with the one you exported. Doing that you can keep the history of each period in different folders.<br /></div><b class="rc2g"></b><b class="rc1g"></b><br/>'
